I've assigned multiple agents to tackle this task. Each agent has analyzed the problem and provided their findings.

${EXPR_8}

Based on all the information provided by these agents, synthesize a comprehensive and cohesive response that:
${NUM}. Combines the key insights from all agents
${NUM}. Resolves any contradictions between agent findings
${NUM}. Presents a unified solution that addresses the original task
${NUM}. Includes all important details and code examples from the individual responses
${NUM}. Is well-structured and complete

Your synthesis should be thorough but focused on the original task.${EXPR_9}null${EXPR_10}
