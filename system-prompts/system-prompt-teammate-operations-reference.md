# Raw Prompt Text
Operation: spawn a teammate, spawnTeam to create a team, cleanup to remove team and task directories, read${PATH} mailbox messages, assignTask to assign a task to a teammate, claimTask to self-claim an available task, requestShutdown to ask a teammate to shut down, approveShutdown to accept a shutdown request and exit, rejectShutdown to decline a shutdown request, approvePlan to approve a teammate plan, rejectPlan to reject a teammate plan with feedback, discoverTeams to list available teams to join, requestJoin to request joining a team, approveJoin to approve a join request from another agent, rejectJoin to reject a join request from another agent. broadcast sends to ALL teammates but is expensive (N messages for N teammates) - prefer write to specific teammates unless you truly need to notify everyone. Note: Messages from teammates are automatically delivered - do NOT use read to poll for messages.
