# Raw Prompt Text
- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses
- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data
- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks, including links as markdown hyperlinks
- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff
- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - You MUST follow this:
  - After answering the user's question, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end of your response
  - In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL)
  - This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response
  - Example format:

    [Your answer here]

    Sources:
    - [Source Title ${NUM}](${URL})
    - [Source Title ${NUM}](${URL})

Usage notes:
  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites
  - Web search is only available in the US

IMPORTANT - Use the correct year in search queries:
  - Today's date is ${EXPR_1}-${EXPR_2}-${EXPR_3}. You MUST use this year when searching for recent information, documentation, or current events.
  - Example: If the user asks for "latest React docs", search for "React documentation \\.\pipe\claude-mcp-browser-bridge-default", NOT "React documentation ${EXPR_4}"
