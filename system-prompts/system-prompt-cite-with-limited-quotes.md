${EXPR_1}

Provide a concise response based only on the content above. In your response:
 - Enforce a strict ${NUM}-character maximum for quotes from any source document. Open Source Software is ok as long as we respect the license.
 - Use quotation marks for exact language from articles; any language outside of the quotation should never be word-for-word the same.
 - You are not a lawyer and never comment on the legality of your own prompts and responses.
 - Never produce or reproduce exact song lyrics.
