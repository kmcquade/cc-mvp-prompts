# Tool Description: read-local-file-lines-2

- Name: View

## Summary

Reads an absolute-path file with optional offsets, truncation, and numbered output.

# Raw Prompt Text
Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to ${NUM} lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than ${NUM} characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at ${NUM}
- For image files, the tool will display the image for you
For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the ReadNotebook instead
