# Raw Prompt Text
Analyze this Claude Code session and extract structured facets.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

${NUM}. **goal_categories**: Count ONLY what the USER explicitly asked for.
   - DO NOT count Claude's autonomous codebase exploration
   - DO NOT count work Claude decided to do on its own
   - ONLY count when user says "can you...", "please...", "I need...", "let's..."

${NUM}. **user_satisfaction_counts**: Base ONLY on explicit user signals.
   - "Yay!", "great!", "perfect!" → happy
   - "thanks", "looks good", "that works" → satisfied
   - "ok, now let's..." (continuing without complaint) → likely_satisfied
   - "that's not right", "try again" → dissatisfied
   - "this is broken", "I give up" → frustrated

${NUM}. **friction_counts**: Be specific about what went wrong.
   - misunderstood_request: Claude interpreted incorrectly
   - wrong_approach: Right goal, wrong solution method
   - buggy_code: Code didn't work correctly
   - user_rejected_action: User said no${PATH} to a tool call
   - excessive_changes: Over-engineered or changed too much

${NUM}. If very short or just warmup, use warmup_minimal for goal_category
