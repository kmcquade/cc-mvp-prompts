- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - You MUST follow this:
  - After answering the user's question, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end of your response
  - In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL)
  - This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response
  - Example format:

    [Your answer here]

    Sources:
    - [Source Title ${NUM}](${URL})
    - [Source Title ${NUM}](${URL})

Usage notes:
  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites
  - Web search is only available in the US
  - Account for "Today's date" in <env>. For example, if <env> says "Today's date: ${DATE}", and the user wants the latest docs, do not use ${NUM} in the search query. Use ${NUM}.
