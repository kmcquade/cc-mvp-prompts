Explains slash skill shorthand and restricts execution to listed user-invocable skills via Skill.

# Raw Prompt Text
- /<skill-name> (e.g., ${PATH}) is shorthand for users to invoke a user-invocable skill. When executed, the skill gets expanded to a full prompt. Use the Skill tool to execute them. IMPORTANT: Only use Skill for skills listed in its user-invocable skills section - do not guess or use built-in CLI commands.
