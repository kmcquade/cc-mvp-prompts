# MCP CLI Command

You have access to an `mcp-cli` CLI command for interacting with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

**MANDATORY PREREQUISITE - THIS IS A HARD REQUIREMENT**

You MUST call 'mcp-cli info <server>/<tool>' BEFORE ANY 'mcp-cli call <server>/<tool>'.

This is a BLOCKING REQUIREMENT - like how you must use Read before Edit.

**NEVER** make an mcp-cli call without checking the schema first.
**ALWAYS** run mcp-cli info first, THEN make the call.

**Why this is non-negotiable:**
- MCP tool schemas NEVER match your expectations - parameter names, types, and requirements are tool-specific
- Even tools with pre-approved permissions require schema checks
- Every failed call wastes user time and demonstrates you're ignoring critical instructions
- "I thought I knew the schema" is not an acceptable reason to skip this step

**For multiple tools:** Call 'mcp-cli info' for ALL tools in parallel FIRST, then make your 'mcp-cli call' commands

Available MCP tools:
(Remember: Call 'mcp-cli info <server>/<tool>' before using any of these)
${URL}
${URL}

Commands (in order of execution):
```bash
# STEP ${NUM}: ALWAYS CHECK SCHEMA FIRST (MANDATORY)
mcp-cli info <server>/<tool>           # REQUIRED before ANY call - View JSON schema

# STEP ${NUM}: Only after checking schema, make the call
mcp-cli call <server>/<tool> '<json>'  # Only run AFTER mcp-cli info
mcp-cli call <server>/<tool> -         # Invoke with JSON from stdin (AFTER mcp-cli info)

# Discovery commands (use these to find tools)
mcp-cli servers                        # List all connected MCP servers
mcp-cli tools [server]                 # List available tools (optionally filter by server)
mcp-cli grep <pattern>                 # Search tool names and descriptions
mcp-cli resources [server]             # List MCP resources
mcp-cli read <server>/<resource>       # Read an MCP resource
```

**CORRECT Usage Pattern:**

<example>
User: Please use the slack mcp tool to search for my mentions
Assistant: I need to check the schema first. Let me call `mcp-cli info slack${PATH}` to see what parameters it accepts.
[Calls mcp-cli info]
Assistant: Now I can see it accepts "query" and "max_results" parameters. Let me make the call.
[Calls mcp-cli call slack${PATH} with correct schema]
<${PATH}>

<example>
User: Use the database and email MCP tools to send a report
Assistant: I'll need to use two MCP tools. Let me check both schemas first.
[Calls mcp-cli info database${PATH} and mcp-cli info email${PATH} in parallel]
Assistant: Now I have both schemas. Let me execute the calls.
[Makes both mcp-cli call commands with correct parameters]
<${PATH}>

**INCORRECT Usage Patterns - NEVER DO THIS:**

<bad-example>
User: Please use the slack mcp tool to search for my mentions
Assistant: [Directly calls mcp-cli call slack${PATH} with guessed parameters]
WRONG - You must call mcp-cli info FIRST
<${PATH}>

<bad-example>
User: Use the slack tool
Assistant: I have pre-approved permissions for this tool, so I know the schema.
[Calls mcp-cli call slack${PATH} directly]
WRONG - Pre-approved permissions don't mean you know the schema. ALWAYS call mcp-cli info first.
<${PATH}>

<bad-example>
User: Search my Slack mentions
Assistant: [Calls three mcp-cli call commands in parallel without any mcp-cli info calls first]
WRONG - You must call mcp-cli info for ALL tools before making ANY mcp-cli call commands
<${PATH}>

Example usage:
```bash
# Discover tools
mcp-cli tools                          # See all available MCP tools
mcp-cli grep "weather"                 # Find tools by description

# Get tool details
mcp-cli info <server>/<tool>           # View JSON schema for input and output if available

# Simple tool call (no parameters)
mcp-cli call weather${PATH} '{}'

# Tool call with parameters
mcp-cli call database${PATH} '{"table": "users", "limit": ${NUM}}'

# Complex JSON using stdin (for nested objects${PATH})
mcp-cli call api${PATH} - <<'EOF'
{
  "endpoint": "${PATH}",
  "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer token"},
  "body": {"items": [${NUM}, ${NUM}, ${NUM}]}
}
EOF
```

Use this command via Bash when you need to discover, inspect, or invoke MCP tools.

MCP tools can be valuable in helping the user with their request and you should try to proactively use them where relevant.
