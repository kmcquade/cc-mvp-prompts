# Raw Prompt Text
You have been asked to add a memory or update memories in the memory file at ${EXPR_1}.

Please follow these guidelines:
- If the input is an update to an existing memory, edit or replace the existing entry
- Do not elaborate on the memory or add unnecessary commentary
- Preserve the existing structure of the file and integrate new memories naturally. If the file is empty, just add the new memory as a bullet entry, do not add any headings.
