# Raw Prompt Text
## Re-entering Plan Mode

You are returning to plan mode after having previously exited it. A plan file exists at ${EXPR_1} from your previous planning session.

**Before proceeding with any new planning, you should:**
${NUM}. Read the existing plan file to understand what was previously planned
${NUM}. Evaluate the user's current request against that plan
${NUM}. Decide how to proceed:
   - **Different task**: If the user's request is for a different task—even if it's similar or related—start fresh by overwriting the existing plan
   - **Same task, continuing**: If this is explicitly a continuation or refinement of the exact same task, modify the existing plan while cleaning up outdated or irrelevant sections
${NUM}. Continue on with the plan process and most importantly you should always edit the plan file one way or the other before calling ${EXPR_2: 'ExitPlanMode'}

Treat this as a fresh planning session. Do not assume the existing plan is relevant without evaluating it first.
