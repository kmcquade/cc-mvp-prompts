# Raw Prompt Text
# Keybindings Skill
Create or modify `~${PATH}` to customize keyboard shortcuts.
## CRITICAL: Read Before Write
**Always read `~${PATH}` first** (it may not exist yet). Merge changes with existing bindings — never replace the entire file.
- Use **Edit** tool for modifications to existing files
- Use **Write** tool only if the file does not exist yet

## File Format
```json
${EXPR_1}
```
Always include the `$schema` and `$docs` fields.

## Keystroke Syntax
**Modifiers** (combine with `+`):
- `ctrl` (alias: `control`)
- `alt` (aliases: `opt`, `option`) — note: `alt` and `meta` are identical in terminals
- `shift`
- `meta` (aliases: `cmd`, `command`)
**Special keys**: `escape`/`esc`, `enter`/`return`, `tab`, `space`, `backspace`, `delete`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`
**Chords**: Space-separated keystrokes, e.g. `ctrl+k ctrl+s` (${NUM}-second timeout between keystrokes)
**Examples**: `ctrl+shift+p`, `alt+enter`, `ctrl+k ctrl+n`

## Unbinding Default Shortcuts
Set a key to `null` to remove its default binding:
```json
${EXPR_2}
```

## How User Bindings Interact with Defaults
- User bindings are **additive** — they are appended after the default bindings
- To **move** a binding to a different key: unbind the old key (`null`) AND add the new binding
- A context only needs to appear in the user's file if they want to change something in that context

## Common Patterns
### Rebind a key
To change the external editor shortcut from `ctrl+g` to `ctrl+e`:
```json
${EXPR_3}
```
### Add a chord binding
```json
${EXPR_4}
```

## Behavioral Rules
${NUM}. Only include contexts the user wants to change (minimal overrides)
${NUM}. Validate that actions and contexts are from the known lists below
${NUM}. Warn the user proactively if they choose a key that conflicts with reserved shortcuts or common tools like tmux (`ctrl+b`) and screen (`ctrl+a`)
${NUM}. When adding a new binding for an existing action, the new binding is additive (existing default still works unless explicitly unbound)
${NUM}. To fully replace a default binding, unbind the old key AND add the new one

## Validation with ${PATH}
The `${PATH}` command includes a "Keybinding Configuration Issues" section that validates `~${PATH}`.
### Common Issues and Fixes
| ${EXPR_5} |
| ${EXPR_6} |
### Example ${PATH} Output
```
Keybinding Configuration Issues
Location: ~${PATH}
  └ [Error] Unknown context "chat"
    → Valid contexts: Global, Chat, Autocomplete, ...
  └ [Warning] "ctrl+c" may not work: Terminal interrupt (SIGINT)
```
**Errors** prevent bindings from working and must be fixed. **Warnings** indicate potential conflicts but the binding may still work.
