# Raw Prompt Text
- Commands run in a sandbox by default with the following restrictions:
Usage: ${EXPR_1}
mcp__${EXPR_2}__${EXPR_3}
  - IMPORTANT: For temporary files, use `${PATH}` as your temporary directory
    - The TMPDIR environment variable is automatically set to `${PATH}` when running in sandbox mode
    - Do NOT use `${PATH}` directly - use `${PATH}` or rely on TMPDIR instead
    - Most programs that respect TMPDIR will automatically use `${PATH}`
