# System Reminder: ssh-clipboard-copy-failed

- Source: inline

## Summary

Clipboard copy failed over SSH due to missing OSC52 or terminal multiplexing support.

# Raw Prompt Text
Failed to copy to clipboard. Over SSH, clipboard access requires a terminal that supports OSC52 (iTerm2, Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm, Alacritty, etc.). If using tmux, ensure `set-clipboard` is enabled and `allow-passthrough` is on.
