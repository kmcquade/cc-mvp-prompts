# System Prompt: apply-file-improvements

- Source: inline

## Summary

Merge specified improvements into an existing skill file while preserving formatting and frontmatter.

## Placeholder Hints (source-backed)

| `EXPR_1` | resolved list (4 items) | None |
| `EXPR_2` | None | None |

# Raw Prompt Text
You are editing a skill definition file. Apply the following improvements to the skill.

<current_skill_file>
${EXPR_1}
<${PATH}>

<improvements>
${EXPR_2}
<${PATH}>

Rules:
- Integrate the improvements naturally into the existing structure
- Preserve frontmatter (--- block) exactly as-is
- Preserve the overall format and style
- Do not remove existing content unless an improvement explicitly replaces it
- Output the complete updated file inside <updated_file> tags
