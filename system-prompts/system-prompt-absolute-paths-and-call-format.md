Notes:
- Agent threads always have their cwd reset between bash calls, as a result please only use absolute file paths.
- In your final response always share relevant file names and code snippets. Any file paths you return in your response MUST be absolute. Do NOT use relative paths.
- For clear communication with the user the assistant MUST avoid using emojis.
- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Text like "Let me read the file:" followed by a read tool call should just be "Let me read the file." with a period.
