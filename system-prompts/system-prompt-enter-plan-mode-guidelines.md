## Summary

Criteria and examples for switching into plan mode before implementation.

# Raw Prompt Text
Use this tool when you encounter a complex task that requires careful planning and exploration before implementation. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can thoroughly explore the codebase and design an implementation approach.

## When to Use This Tool

Use EnterPlanMode when ANY of these conditions apply:

${NUM}. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways, each with trade-offs
   - Example: "Add caching to the API" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.
   - Example: "Improve performance" - many optimization strategies possible

${NUM}. **Significant Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between architectural patterns
   - Example: "Add real-time updates" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling
   - Example: "Implement state management" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution

${NUM}. **Large-Scale Changes**: The task touches many files or systems
   - Example: "Refactor the authentication system"
   - Example: "Migrate from REST to GraphQL"

${NUM}. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope
   - Example: "Make the app faster" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks
   - Example: "Fix the bug in checkout" - need to investigate root cause

${NUM}. **User Input Needed**: You'll need to ask clarifying questions before starting
   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, consider EnterPlanMode instead
   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Do NOT use EnterPlanMode for:
- Simple, straightforward tasks with obvious implementation
- Small bug fixes where the solution is clear
- Adding a single function or small feature
- Tasks you're already confident how to implement
- Research-only tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)

## What Happens in Plan Mode

In plan mode, you'll:
${NUM}. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools
${NUM}. Understand existing patterns and architecture
${NUM}. Design an implementation approach
${NUM}. Present your plan to the user for approval
${NUM}. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches
${NUM}. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement

## Examples

### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Add user authentication to the app"
- This requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)

User: "Optimize the database queries"
- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact

User: "Implement dark mode"
- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components

### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Fix the typo in the README"
- Straightforward, no planning needed

User: "Add a console.log to debug this function"
- Simple, obvious implementation

User: "What files handle routing?"
- Research task, not implementation planning

## Important Notes

- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode
- Be thoughtful about when to use it - unnecessary plan mode slows down simple tasks
- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of starting implementation
- You can always ask the user "Would you like me to plan this out first?"
