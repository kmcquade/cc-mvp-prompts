| `tengu_prompt_suggestion` | gate | prompts | Enable prompt suggestions setting in user preferences UI. | Gates only the settings toggle visibility. | high | 1 |
| `tengu_scratch` | gate | filesystem | enable temporary scratchpad directory for session memory summaries | Behavior inferred from nearby path construction and conditional check. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_session_index` | gate | filesystem | Controls using a cached sessions index file when loading session data | Flag only shown as a gate return; full behavior not visible. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_session_memory` | gate | caching | Enable persistent session memory and compact summaries in CLI repl. | Inferred from file read/write and repl_main_thread gating. | medium | 2 |
| `tengu_sm_compact` | gate | prompts | Enables compact summary messages for session memory handling in CLI transcript. | Only seen as combined gate check; exact behavior elsewhere unknown. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_sm_config` | config | caching | Configure thresholds for initializing and updating session memory based on tokens and tool calls | Only shows config read and threshold fields, not how updates are applied. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_streaming_tool_execution2` | gate | tools | Gates creation of a tool-execution handler in the streaming CLI request loop | Only observed gating EV0 construction; exact behavior of EV0 is unclear. | high | 1 |
| `tengu_sumi` | gate | tools | controls CLI stream I/O configuration or console patching behavior | Only appears as a simple gate in a CLI helper. | low | 1 |
| `tengu_teams_usage_limit_notifications` | experiment | ui | Enable usage limit notifications when running in team context. | Only applies if another gate is enabled and context is "team". | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_thinkback` | gate | tools | Enables Thinkback year-in-review command and hidden animation playback tool | Controls availability of local CLI/plugin commands. | high | 2 |
| `tengu_tool_pear` | gate | tools | Enables stricter tool schema/strict mode when using specific models in CLI tool definitions | Exact behavior of OV0/Ey2 unknown from snippet. | medium | 2 |
| `tengu_tool_search_unsupported_models` | experiment | tools | Provides list of model substrings that disable tool search support checks | Used to filter model names by substring match. | high | 1 |
