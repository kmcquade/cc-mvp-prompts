| `tengu_mcp_tool_search` | experiment | tools | Selects a test mode for tool search behavior in the MCP CLI. | Exact behavior of "tst" mode not shown. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_permission_explainer` | experiment | tools | Enable permission explanation text for tool invocations in CLI. | Only one occurrence; behavior inferred from toolName/toolDescription string building. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_pid_based_version_locking` | experiment | filesystem | Enable PID-based version locking to avoid concurrent or conflicting runs | Only PID/process check context is visible. | low | 1 |
| `tengu_plan_mode_interview_phase` | experiment | prompts | Enables an interview phase in plan mode behavior in the CLI. | Only a flag getter is shown; no downstream usage context. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_remote_backend` | experiment | networking | Permits starting a remote session without an initial description for the CLI remote command. | Only seen gating the missing-description error path. | high | 1 |
| `tengu_scratch` | gate | filesystem | enable temporary scratchpad directory for session memory summaries | Behavior inferred from nearby path construction and conditional check. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_session_memory` | experiment | caching | Enable persistent session memory and compact summaries in CLI repl. | Inferred from file read/write and repl_main_thread gating. | medium | 2 |
| `tengu_sm_compact` | experiment | prompts | Enables compact summary messages for session memory handling in CLI transcript. | Only seen as combined gate check; exact behavior elsewhere unknown. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_sm_compact_config` | config | prompts | Configure compaction thresholds using token and message count limits | Only token/message limit fields are visible. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_streaming_tool_execution2` | gate | tools | Gates creation of a tool-execution handler in the streaming CLI request loop | Only observed gating EV0 construction; exact behavior of EV0 is unclear. | high | 1 |
| `tengu_thinkback` | gate | tools | Enables Thinkback year-in-review command and hidden animation playback tool | Controls availability of local CLI/plugin commands. | high | 2 |
| `tengu_tool_pear` | gate | tools | Enables stricter tool schema/strict mode when using specific models in CLI tool definitions | Exact behavior of OV0/Ey2 unknown from snippet. | medium | 2 |
| `tengu_tool_search_unsupported_models` | experiment | tools | Provides list of model substrings that disable tool search support checks | Used to filter model names by substring match. | high | 1 |
| `tengu_version_config` | config | ui | Checks minimum required CLI version and instructs user to update if outdated. | Used for runtime version gating and update messaging. | high | 1 |
| `tengu_vscode_onboarding` | gate | ui | Controls whether VSCode connected experience shows onboarding flow | Only seen declared and sent as a gate; no UI behavior shown. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_vscode_review_upsell` | gate | ui | Enable VS Code review upsell experiment gate sent to connected client. | Only shows gate transmission and event logging, not the upsell UI itself. | medium | 1 |
| `tool_use_examples` | experiment | tools | Include tool input example data and enable related first-party tool option. | Applies only when enabled; one path gated to firstParty. | high | 1 |
