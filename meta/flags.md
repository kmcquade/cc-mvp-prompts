| `tengu_log_1p_events` | gate | telemetry | Enables emitting first-party telemetry events with IDs and session/user attributes. | Also gated by EV(), K0(), and GB0 availability. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_native_installation` | gate | filesystem | Controls whether CLI creates/uses native launcher script when claude.sh missing | Inference based on file checks and symlink creation logic. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_opus_default_pro_plan` | experiment | tools | Controls whether Opus is the default model for plan subscribers | Exact effect inferred from nearby model/plan selection logic. | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_session_memory` | gate | caching | Enable persistent session memory and compact summaries in CLI repl. | Inferred from file read/write and repl_main_thread gating. | medium | 2 |
| `tengu_sm_compact` | gate | prompts | Enables compact summary messages for session memory handling in CLI transcript. | Only seen as combined gate check; exact behavior elsewhere unknown. | medium | 1 |

| `tengu_sumi` | gate | tools | controls CLI stream I/O configuration or console patching behavior | Only appears as a simple gate in a CLI helper. | low | 1 |
| `tengu_teams_usage_limit_notifications` | experiment | ui | Enable usage limit notifications when running in team context. | Only applies if another gate is enabled and context is "team". | medium | 1 |
| `tengu_tool_pear` | gate | tools | Enables stricter tool schema/strict mode when using specific models in CLI tool definitions | Exact behavior of OV0/Ey2 unknown from snippet. | medium | 2 |
